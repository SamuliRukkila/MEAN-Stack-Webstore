# MEAN-Stack-Webstore

Visit this [SITE](https://suhautus-webstore-front.herokuapp.com/#/etusivu).

This is a fully working web-store created from stratch using Angular 6.x.x, Bootstrap and Node.js. Only thing which is missing is payment-methods (since this is only a student-project).

### Note!

The whole application resides in Heroku using only free plans so the first time you visit the site it can take some time before it fully loads.

## Program

This is an online web-store made possible by MEAN-STACK (MongoDb, Express, Angular & Node.js).
Both frontend and backend resides in Heroku.

## What is possible

In this web-application, you can login, register, make order or just watch what kind of products this web-store could possible sell. All your information will be stored in MLab (MongoDB cloud-storage). **Do not** use your real credentials for this site.

## Admin

When you're admin-user, you can update, delete or create new products and also see minified information from your users.
You can mess around with them all you want - database is backed up.

**Admin credentials**:
- Username: admin.admin@admin.fi
- Password: ASDasd123
